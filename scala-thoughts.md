    - I like writing functions in scala actually. They strike a good balance between something like C++ and python in terms of control + ease of definition. So far I havent noticed anything too difficult, but loops seem to be a little wonky, since its mostly a functional program. Once we get into the class definitions im sure that might be better / worse. I think scala is best as a light functional language then the other way around. 

    Sor far, what is/are your favorite language design choice(s) that the designers of Scala made? Why?

    - I think my favourite design decision is "Last function is returned" thing. Its nice easy and intuitive (and memorable). Overall, the structure is very consistant aswell. That is, Whenever I guess how something is formatted before looking it up (based on what ive written before) I am usually right or close to it. 

    So far, what is/are your least favorite language design choice(s)? Why? And why do you think the designers made that / those choice(s)?

    - There might be a reason for this, but I hate you have to do val/var before each variable. Its just really annoying. I always forget and the error it summons is annoying. I havent successfully used [] on a list yet. If thats not in the language then thats a bad choice imo. However, i could just have been doing it wrong. [] is so basic I think every langauge should be required to have some version of it. 

    What Scala features would you like to learn more about?

    - As I said above, if there is list comprehension + list tools I would like to know them.
